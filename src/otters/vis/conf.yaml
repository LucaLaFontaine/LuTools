##### NOTES #####
  # This is the default configuration for plots created using otters.
    # Everything in this file will be superceded by the user, it's just a default

  # What if you want to make changes to this file? Idk the best way to do that.
    # Currently my rec is to keep a config file like on you desktop and overwrite it every time with that one.
    # This is not an elegant solution, but it's the best i can think of.

##### CONFIG #####
  ##### Y AXIS #####
    # Sets range of Y axis. necessary to hardcode 0 as the origin. then go to 20% higher than highest number
    yAxisRange : [0, 1.1]

  ##### X AXIS #####
    # Max number of ticks you can have in the x axis. Not entirely sure how to regulate this but 25 looks nice as a first glance. More complexity is absolutely needed. 
    xMaxTicks : 25

    # Angle of x labels
    xTickAngle : -35

  ##### Graph Sizing #####
    # Width/height of graph in px I think. tied to aspect ratio below. Keep in mind this affects the quality of the image. 
    plotWidth : 1200
    plotHeight: 
    # Aspect Ratio of graphs
    aspectRatio : 0.5

    # Margin of the chart area I'm pretty sure. Should this prolly default to 0 for all of them?
    margin: {
      l: 30, 
      r: 10, 
      t: 100, 
      b: 60,
    }

  ##### Colours #####
    # Colors used for the datasets in a graph. Follows the EPS Style guide. There are 6 here
    lineColours : ['#08549e', '#FF883E', '#A14494', '#ffcd38', '#0ac798', '#10A8FF',]

  ##### TIME STUFF #####
    # Default timestamp tick
    tickFormat: '%a %d/%b/%y %H'

    # Frequency of ticks. D1 is daily, M2 is bi-monthly. can also use logs and stuff, look up 'plotly dtick'
    # There may be some value in checking the length of the timestamp and auto assinging daily, weekly, monthly, etc but only do it if it becomes a problem
    # Supercedes XMaxTicks surprisingly
    dTick : 'D1'

    # Okay this is kind of stupid. [2000, 1, 3] is the first monday of the century, so whatever day you want ticks to be have to scale to that. so [2000, 1, 5, 6, 0] for Wednesdays at 6am
    tick0 : {
        year: 2000, 
        month: 1, 
        day: 3, 
        hour: 0, 
        minute: 0,
    }
